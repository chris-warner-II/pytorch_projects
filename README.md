**PyTorch Portfolio Projects**

This repo contains a number of projects implementing machine learning in PyTorch.

* `helper_functions.py` - contains definitions of functions used throughout notebooks
* `models.py` - contains class definitions of models used throughout notebooks
<p>  </p> 

* `01_Linear_Regression.ipynb` - implements linear regression on linear and non-linear data with 1-layer linear NN, 3-layer linear NN model and 3-layer nonlinear NN model.
<p>  </p> 

* `02_Binary_Classification.ipynb` - implements binary classification on some datasets that are not linearly separable
<p>  </p> 

* `03_Multi_Classification.ipynb` - implements multi class classification 
<p> </p>

* `04_Computer_Vision.ipynb` - explores FashionMNIST dataset to do classification using linear, non-linear networks and finally using a CNN architecture.
